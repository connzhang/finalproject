Accidental drug-related deaths are an ongoing public health concern at a national level, and in the state of Connecticut in particular. Opioid overdose deaths in Connecticut has doubled over the past six years, largely driven by the recreational use of a combination of multiple drugs. The motivation for this project is to analyze and report on local geogographic and demographic trends related to drug overdose deaths in recent years.
