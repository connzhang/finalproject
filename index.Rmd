Accidental drug-related deaths are an ongoing public health concern on a national level, and in the state of Connecticut in particular. Opioid overdose deaths in Connecticut doubled in the past six years, largely driven by use of multiple drugs together. Our motivation for this project is to analyze and report on local geogographic and demographic trends related to drug overdose deaths in recent years.
