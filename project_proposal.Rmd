## Project Title (tentative)
Assessment of Drug Use and Mortality in Connecticut

## Motivation for project 
Accidental drug-related deaths are an ongoing public health concern on a national level, and in the state of Connecticut in particular. Our motivation for this project is to analyze and report on local geogographic and demographic trends related to drug overdose deaths in recent years. 

## Intended final products 
Analysis page, final report page, screen cast, and some sort of interactive visualization page. 

## Anticipated Data Sources 
Data extracted from Data.gov related to accidental death associated with drug overdose in state of Connecticut from 2012 to 2018. Different substances, locations, and states of official residents are all example variables. 

Data includes Office of Chief Medical Examiner information on toxicity, death certificates, and scene information upon death.

## Planned analyses, visualizations, coding challenges
This project will look at accidental deaths and drug use  demographics over time in the state of Connecticut. For example, differences in gender, race, and age will be assessed. Visualizations may includes maps of drug use and death across different regions of the state or box plots of death by drug type. 

Anticipated coding challenges could include making external generalizations and assumptions from our analyses to a national level, since this dataset may only capture a very specific population of individuals who are hospitalized and seeking treatment.
